Homework for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data

# Using the Script

1. Check out this repository.

2. Change directory to the check out directory.

3. Run the R script run_analysis.R which will create a new sub-directory called activity into which will be downloaded the zipped dataset [Link to data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).  The script will then unzip the dataset and perform the analysis.  If the dataset has already been downloaded and unzipped, analysis will begin inmmediately.

4. The output files (tidy.txt and combined_data.txt) will be written into the activity directory.
